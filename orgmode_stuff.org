* Orgmode
** Things I learned from the manual

*** M-S works on subtree
**** M-S <left> or <right> promotes/demotes entire sub-tree
I've needed this many times!!
**** M-S <up> or <down> moves entire sub-tree up or down

*** org-log-done Setting
(setq org-log-done 'time) to log timestamp of when task was
completed.  I used to have this set to 'note and every time I finished
a task it would ask me to write a closing note, which was annoying and
overkill for my use cases.
*** add/remove files from agenda
**** add file to agenda C-c [ 
**** remove file from agenda C-c ]

*** Timestamps
**** add a timestamp with C-c .
**** Plain Timestamp <2011-05-22 >
     Add a plain timestamp to any headline and the headline will appear in the
     agenda on the day of the timestamp.
**** Meet Steven at Movies <2011-05-22 19:15>
     If you add a time, then a date/time planner will pop up on that day.
**** Scheduling an item vs. plain timestamp
     Scheduled: is the timestamp when you want to start working on an
     action item, not say when a meeting or dinner date is scheduled.
     For those, just add a plain timestamp to the header.
*** Org-capture
    in org 7+ org-remember has been added into org as org-capture
** tracking habits
*** how to set up Habit Tracking
**** add org-habit to org-modules list
**** put in :properties: for the todo that :style: habit
**** set a repeating schedule 
     .+2d/4d would mean every 2 to 4 days.
