This output shows (in the RX-OK column) that packets have been received
error-free on the lo (loopback) and wlan1 (wireless) interface,
however, no packets have been transferred on eth1, therefore either the
ethernet is down or unplugged.  Also the TX-OK column shows that
packets have been transmitted on those interfaces as well.
