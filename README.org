I use org-publish to 
1. transform them into HTML, using the projects headers and css files
   and 
2. to publish them to my server.

its pretty neat.  
I can edit the org-mode source files in Emacs and 
+ type in C-c C-e P to publish the entire project.
or
+ type in C-c C-E F to just publish the current file
