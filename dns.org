* What is DNS?
DNS stands for Domain Name System.  It is a service that maps a human
readable domain name, like majorursa.net, to a computer readable
numeric address (or dotted quad) 173.230.154.132

* Setting up a DNS entry On a DNS server using BIND
** There are three files that need to be changed
*** named.conf
This file contains pointers to zone files for each domain (as well as
some bind configuration directives.)

Add a line at the end of /etc/named.conf that will point to the zone
file for your new domain:
#+begin_html
<pre>
primary         majorursa.net     named.hosts
</pre>
#+end_html

*** named.hosts
This is a file with zone information for your domain. It lists the
file where domain configuration is stored.
#+begin_html
<pre>
zone "majorursa.net" {
    type "master";
    file "named.hosts";
};
</pre>
#+end_html

*** named.hosts
This is the file where you point each domain name at an IP address or
another domain name
#+begin_html
<pre>

</pre>
#+end_html
